Citrix UPM - FSLogix Migration Script
This is a heavy modifcation of this script here to suit my enviroment https://blog.fslogix.com/citrix-upm-profiles-to-fslogix-profiles-conversion-powershell-script. 

-- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. i.e. Make sure to read the script and see what it's doing before blindly running it. 

This script converts Citrix UPM Profiles to FSLogix VHDXs. It also copies MS redirected folders inside the FSlogix VHDx as well.
